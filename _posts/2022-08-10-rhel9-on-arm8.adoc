# Introduction

The next guide will show how to roll-out RHEL for Edge 9 on a single board 64-bit native computer: https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/[Raspberry Pi 4].

The purpose of this blog is to demo the capability of Red Hat Enterprise Linux on ARMv8 devices.

Please keep in mind *RPi 4 is not officially supported by Red Hat OS*.

# Hardware

For this demo you'll need the following components:

* Raspberry Pi4 with 4 or 8 GB https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/specifications/[Specs]
* SD-Card to boot your OS from (4+ Gb recommended)
* A USB-Stick (temporary) for the installation process

# Software

For this demo you'll need the following components:

* https://developers.redhat.com/products/rhel/overview[Red Hat Enterprise Linux]
* RPi 4 tools


# Preparation

Follow the steps below to prepare your SD card: 

* Partition 1, 100 MB, partition type EFI (ef)
* Partition 2, 1000 MB, Type Linux
* Partition 3, rest of the SD-Card, Type Linux
* Format your Partition 1 as FAT (12, 16 or 32, doesn't matter)
* Download https://github.com/pftf/RPi4[EFI Firmware for PI4]
* Unpack content of the EFI-Firmware compressed archive to the Partition 1 of the SD Card
* Flash the RHEL 9 ARM64 ISO to your USB Stick (we recommend using the 'dd' command)


# Installation

* Plug the SD-Card, USB-Stick, Mouse, Keyboard, Network Cable and HDMI-Monitor into your RPi 4;
* Bootthe device and Press ESC on the EFI Boot Screen;
* Enter the Boot Manager, chose USB Stick to boot from;
* Run through the RHEL-9-Setup Dialog, choose Packages, Registration, Locales, Timezone etc as needed;
* Set a root password and create a standard user.

# Disk config

*WARNING* The RHEL-Installer does not accept the existing EFI-Partition as a valid filesystem. 

Create a new one and (re)transfer the Pi-UEFI-Firmware after the installation before first boot, after the installation process is completed successfully.

* Select *Partition 1*
** Select "reformat partition" and choose "EFI System Parttion";
** Select _"/boot/efi"_ as mountpoint
* Select *Partition 2* (1000MB);
** Select reformat
** Choose ext4 Filesystem and _"/boot"_ as Mountpoint
* Select *Partition 3* (remaining space on the SD Card);
** Select _Reformat_;
** Choose _ext4_ or _xfs_ as Filesystem and _"/"_ as Mountpoint
* *Ignore the warning* _"no swap partition specified"_.

Install RHEL 9 and reboot after the installer finished.

At this point, your PI 4 will not start into RHEL 9, since the Installer created a new EFI-Partition.


# How to Fix EFI
* Turn of the PI4, put the SD-Card back into your PC and mount the first partition (EFI).
* Copy the PI4 EFI Firmware to that Partition (again), leave the EFI-Directory from the RHEL-9-Installer as it is.
* Plug the SD back into the Pi4, boot and enter the EFI Boot Shell (F1)

* On the shell type:
```
FS0:
bcfg boot add 0 FS0:\EFI\redhat\grubaa64.efi
```

You should get a message like: 
```
"Target = 000x, bcfg Add Boot000x as 0"
```

With that, now added the RHEL 9 Boot loader as the Default EFI Boot target.

* Type ```reset```;

Your Pi4 will now boot into the RHEL 9 Installation.
