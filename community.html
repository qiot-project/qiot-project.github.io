    <h1>Intro</h1>
    The QIoT project has been kicked off in November 2020 by a small group of redhatters in love with open source to consolidate the outcome of the technical activities behind a business initiative called <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/events/hackfest">Red Hat Hackfest</a>. <br> <br>
    <h1>The Red Hat Hackfest</h1>
    The Red Hat Hackfest is a collaboration event that brings Red Hat’s people, partners, and customers together to create communities that fast track innovation.<br><br>The Red Hat  Hackfest helps scale the Red Hat business through our partner ecosystem by providing an environment that places emphasis on creating value that helps accelerate collaboration and innovation.<br> <br>During the four to six week competition, partners develop their knowledge of Red Hat technology and build on it to create stronger, more tailored, more integrated end-to-end solutions that solve real-word customer business challenges. <br><br> It started in EMEA in 2020, and has resulted in a cohesive community of partners capable of pitching the joint Intel & Red Hat Edge value proposition and owning the skillset to implement solutions to help customers solve their business and technical challenges. <br>Edge micro-communities living in the Red Hat Hackfest environment aliment the continuous development of business opportunities and technology
    adoption of those partners willing to approach the customers in a proactive way. <br>We’re at the point where we are looking to expand to other regions (and launching Hackfest APAC edition soon :). <br><br>Having said that, The technical challenges proposed by the Hackfest technical team come from the effort the community commits into the design, creation and development of 80% solutions in a form of PoCs.<br><br><h1>The Community environment</h1>The Project and the Community have grown overtime and now serve technical people around the world with tools, ideas and the opportunity to discuss about innovation, have fun and tackle technical and business challenges. <br><br>The QIoT Community members offer a voluntary contribution, joining an environment where they can discuss, learn, and share competences and ideas with a large audience of business and technical individuals.<br> Our esteemed members, moreover, belong to several areas such as Red Hat, the Red Hat Partner Ecosystem, and the Upstream communities.<br> <br>The community admins have implemented and made available to you several tools to meet virtually such as a Slack workspace, a public mailing list.<br>We also meet virtually once per week on google meet.<br>All the above mentioned information can be found on the footer of each and every page of our blog.<br> <h1>The mission</h1>The primary mission of the QIoT Community is to implement PoCs and MVPs that help addressing the technical challenges of complex solutions.<br><br>The above-mentioned projects, as outcome of the commitment, effort, and engagement of the community members, must respect the following criteria:<br><br>
    <ul>
      <li>Must be build on top of a modern, distributed architecture;</li>
      <li>Must be built using an enterprise technology stack; <b>*</b></li>
      <li>Must adhere to the 80% solution recommended practice; <b>**</b>
      </li>
      <li>Must be composite of connected, reusable, and independent modules;</li>
    </ul>
    <br> Additionally, each and every outcome/deliverable can be safely and easily used as a baseline for the implementation of customer projects.<br> <br><h1>How do we build solutions</h1>Working on complex projects requires the commitment of several individuals  and quite a broad skillset.<br>And that complexity stands in the compulsory requirement for distributed architectures and security. That's where skillset and expertise come into place.<br>While talking about  distributed workload or architecture could be the easy part, design and implementation try hard the scalability of an enterprise project.<br><br>To make sure the community members always stay on top of their skills and are capable of delivering stable and reusable outcome, we have decided to  compose the &quot;default&quot; technology stack with the latest and greatest from the enterprise portfolio of several software vendors of the IT industry.<br><br>We have also done quite a hard work to identify the common approaches, standards and recommended practices and define the community criteria for our deliverables.<br>The above leads to the need to follow the golden rule of the &quot;80% solution&quot; and make sure that the generic architectural design fits into a business and technical value proposition after we tailor it deployoing applications (business logic) for a specific vertical / use case / business motion:<br><br><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/community/howto-distributed-architectures-vertical.png" width="800"><br> <br> <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/community/howto-distributed-architectures-landscape.png" width="800"><br> <br><h1>Join us!</h1> Feel free to have a look, investigate, test and leave a feedback. <br><br /> We look forward to
    have you joining the project! <br /> <br /> <em>The QIoT admin team</em>
